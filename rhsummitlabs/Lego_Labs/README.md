Since there is no way to map an order around all of the practices and concepts that are gone over during this Lab Session, We have opted to provide list of various practices that are reviewed and typically mentioned during runs of the Lego Labs Session.

Many of the practices and concepts listed here (AND MORE!) can be found on the github project "[Open Practice Library](https://rht-labs.github.io/practice-library/)". If anyone would like to share their knowledge openly, we encourage that as well!
