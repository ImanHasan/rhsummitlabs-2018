image:mobile-fsi-project-summary.png[Mobile Projects Page]

The project contains the following three components:

* *Cloud App FSI* - this is a server-side component written in NodeJs that calls the BPM API and also provides:
** authorisation
** data synchronisation
** Push Notification functionality
** data persistence using a mongo Database.
* *Bank Admin Portal* - this is a back-office web admin portal, written in Ionic/AngularJS, deployed on the RHMAP platform, that demonstrates how a UI can be built on top of BPM Suite for managing live Tasks and Cases.
* *Consumer App xx* - this is a consumer facing hybrid mobile app, written in Ionic/AngularJS/Cordova, deployed to a mobile device, that demonstrates how a customer can order products, which instantiate BPM processes. +

image:mobile-editor.png[Mobile Editor Button]
. You can now see the directory structure and files that make up this NodeJS service
. Open the file */lib/bpm/bpmCalls.js* and have a look at the API calls that are being made
. Click on *Environment Variables* on the left hand side +
image:mobile-env.png[Mobile Env Vars Button]
. Note the various BPM connection variables that have been specified. These can change per environment you deploy to.
. Click on *Data Browser* on the left hand side +
image:mobile-data.png[Mobile Data Browser Button]
. This gives you a view of the data that the cloud app has cached in a Mongo Database. Have a look at some of the data stored in the Cases and Tasks Collections which contain details of the BPM processes.  The remaining collections concern the Sync Framework
. Click on *Deploy* on the left hand side.  You can see that the Cloud App is already built and deployed. Each time you do a build a history record is generated. +
image:mobile-deploy.png[Mobile Deploy Browser Button]
. Click on *Logs* on the left hand side. +
image:mobile-logs.png[Mobile Logs Button]
. Here you can view live logs from the running cloud app to help in debugging issues.

=== Explore the Bank Admin Portal

. Click on the dropdown on the left that currently says Cloud App FSI and choose *Bank Admin Portal* from the list. +
image:mobile-01.png[]
. You will see the App Details page for this client and it will also load inside the App Preview on the right. +
image:mobile-admin-app.png[FSI Mobile Admin App Browser]
. As this is a web portal it is best viewed inside a full browser tab. You can do this by clicking the *Open container in a new tab* icon on the top right of the App Preview. +
image:mobile-02.png[]
. Enter any username, minimum 3 characters length, and any password, and click *Login*
. Have a look at the Dashboard, Case List and Task List pages to get an idea of what can be built using the BPM REST API.
. When you start playing with the customer mobile app and go through the process of ordering products you will see the new Cases and Tasks appear automatically in this portal.

=== Explore the Consumer App
The Consumer App is designed to be installed on a phone. There are instructions below for installing on Android.  For the purposes of the workshop we can user the App Preview on the Mobile Platform in our browser.

. Click on the dropdown on the left again and this time select the *Consumer App* +
image:mobile-consumer-app.png[]
. This time you can use the App Preview to exercise the mobile app in a realistic view
. Enter your allocated username i.e. *summit-student-XX*
. The password is *password* +
image:mobile-consumer-login.png[]
. Click Login
. You will see the list of available Bank Products that can be ordered. +
image:mobile-consumer-products.png[]
. The menu also has a *My Applications* section where you view status of your applications later in the demo +
image:mobile-consumer-applications.png[]
. In the *Settings* screen you can see connection details for the BPM instance +
image:mobile-consumer-settings.png[]

=== Modify the Consumer App to use your own BPM container (Optional)
By default, the Consumer App connects to the BPM default container named *org.jbpm.demo:bpm-mobile-workflows:TEST*. You may continue to use the default BPM Container for the workshop.

If you have created your own Container in the BPM part of the workshop, you can modify the Consumer App to use your own Container as follows:

For this workshop, the Consumer App BPM connection details are stored locally in a config file named *bpm-creds.json*.

. Click on *Editor* on the left hand side
. Ignore any *Failed Request Details* message you may get
. Open file *www/bpm-creds.json*
. update the container field with your own deployed container name

----
{
    "auth": "Basic a2llc2VydmVyOnBhc3N3b3JkMSE=",
    "container": <your container name here>,
    "processName": "org.jbpm.demo.NewApplication",
    "host": <aws host>
  }
----

[start=5]
. Click File and Save +
image:mobile-file-save.png[]
. Return to *Details* section
. Login again in the App Preview section and your Consumer App should connect to your own container when you make a Product Applications
. You can confirm that the connection details have been updated in the Settings screen in the App.  Details can be edited here too. +

=== Build Android version of Consumer App (Optional)
If you have an Android device, you can build and deploy the Consumer App as follows.   (Note:  The RHMAP platform can also build and deploy to iOS, however it is neccessary to upload your Apple credentials first and this is outside the scope of this demo)

. Click on the dropdown on the left select the *Consumer App* again
. (Optional Step) Enable Push Notifications on Android
* Click on *Push* on the left hand side
* Click on *Enable Push* Button
* Click on Android Checkbox
* Enter `AAAAVyB8obo:APA91bEdrZPXpaI9wpGz_19WlLJzoxec77bANuzXcWEGcIjavG6lFkKJA77BStWvXBmtpBmfRS_-jM93scJL4xx0-BJVJuwQwEBUdFjetF697e9crqRFLQDsNYrQk7k1HCoDUCGq9THa` as Server Key
* Enter `374207193530` as Server ID (Ignore Server returned 401: Unathorized message)
* Click on *Enable Push* button
. Click on *Build* on the left hand side
. Select Android
. Scroll down and click the *Build* button
. You can view the Build progress by clicking on the *View Logs* button

. On your Android device, scan the code or type the link into a browser to install the App

=== Execute BPM Process and Tasks using the Consumer App and Bank Admin Portal
Start a new BPM process by Submitting a Product Application from the Consumer App.  Then you switch between the Bank Admin Portal and Consumer App to run the Tasks to complete the process.

. On the *Consumer App*, select one of the products and then click the *Add to Basket Icon* button. +
image:mobile-bpm-product.png[]
. Swipe through the various screens and fill in what you want.  For the purpose of the demo, default values will be added to any fields not filled in but best to complete the Applicant Name fields so you can search for this later.
. On the last screen click the *Submit* button. +
image:mobile-bpm-product-submit.png[]

. This creates a BPM process and returns to the *My Applications* section of the App where you should see you your Application listed as being *_In Progress_* +
image:mobile-bpm-product-app.png[]

. Switch to the Bank Admin Portal and find your Application on the Case List and Task List screens - search by Application name or Case Id if necessary. +
image:mobile-admin-case-created.png[]
. In the Task List Screen, on your application, click the *RUN TASK* arrow to run the *_Assign Internal Owner_* Task.  Select a bank owner and click *Submit* +
image:mobile-assign-internal-owner.png[]
. Task status will change to *_pending_* while the Sync Framework, via the Cloud App,  runs the Task on BPM. +
image:mobile-assign-pending.png[]
. When Task completes, status returns to *_Ready_* and the next Task - *_Application Check_* - is available
image:mobile-application-ready.png[]
. Click the *RUN TASK* arrow icon to run the *_Application Check_* Task.  You can review the Application Details and then click *CONFIRM* and *SUBMIT* buttons to complete the Task +
