== Introduction
In this lab you will configure the Redhat BPMS Single Sign On Adapter.

*Pre-Requisites:*
. Red Hat Single Sign On instance available.
. Red Hat Single Sign On Realm created for the BPMS application along with the relevant users and roles.
. Red Hat BPMS Application installed and running on Redhat EAP 6.4

*Software Downloads Required*
. RH SSO Adapter

== Step 1: Install the Redhat SSO EAP Adapter for EAP.
["arabic"]
. Unzip the RH-SSO-Adapter.zip in the base Redhat EAP directory.
. From the command prompt navigate to the EAP_HOME/bin directory.
. Ensure the EAP domain is up and running.
. Run the following command:
    * ./jboss_cli.sh --connect -file adapter-install.cli
. The Redhat EAP SSO adapter should now be installed.

== Step 2: Configure the Redhat BPMS EAP Domain to use the Redhat SSO BPMS Realm.
["arabic"]
. From the command prompt navigate to the EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration in your EAP installation and edit standalone.xml to add the RH-SSO subsystem configuration.

. secure-deployment name: Name of your applicationâ€™s WAR file.
. realm: Name of the realm that you created for the applications to use.
. realm-public-key: The public key of the realm you created. You can find the key in the Keys tab in the Realm settings page of the realm you created in the RH-SSO Admin Console. If you do not provide a value for realm-public-key, the server retrieves it automatically.
. auth-server-url: The URL for the RH-SSO authentication server.
. enable-basic-auth: The setting to enable basic authentication mechanism, so that the clients can use both token-based and basic authentication approaches to perform the requests.
. resource: The name for the client that you created.
. credential name: The secret key for the client you created. You can find the key in the Credentials tab on the Clients page of the RH-SSO Admin Console.

== Step 3: Secure Business Central Remote Service Using RH-SSO.
. From the command prompt navigate to the EAP_HOME/standalone/deployments/business-central/WEB-INF directory.
. Edit the Web.xml file and remove /comment out the following lines to remove the servlet filter and its mapping for class org.uberfire.ext.security.server.BasicAuthSecurityFilter.
----
<filter>
  <filter-name>HTTP Basic Auth Filter</filter-name>
  <filter-class>org.uberfire.ext.security.server.BasicAuthSecurityFilter</filter-class>
  <init-param>
    <param-name>realmName</param-name>
    <param-value>KIE Workbench Realm</param-value>
  </init-param>
</filter>

<filter-mapping>
  <filter-name>HTTP Basic Auth Filter</filter-name>
  <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
  <url-pattern>/maven2/*</url-pattern>
  <url-pattern>/ws/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
----
In the same Web.xml file add the following lines to add the security-constraint for the url-patterns that you have removed from the filter mapping.
----
<security-constraint>
  <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>remote-services</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
    <url-pattern>/maven2/*</url-pattern>
    <url-pattern>/ws/*</url-pattern>
  </web-resource-collection>
  <auth-constraint>
    <role-name>rest-all</role-name>
  </auth-constraint>
</security-constraint>
----
. Save the changes
. The Redhat BPMS Business Central authorisation and authentication should now be configured to use Redhat SSO.

== Step 4: Test the Redhat BPMS SSO Configuration 
. Open a browser and attempt to access the Business Central url. i.e https://localhost:8080:business-central
. You should be redirected to the Redhat SSO Login page.
. Attempt to login with the credentials you created earlier during the Redhat SSO realm configuration lab.
. You should be prompted to change your password the first time you attempt to login.
. After successfully logging via the Redhat SSO login page you should be redirected back to the BPMS Business-Central page.
