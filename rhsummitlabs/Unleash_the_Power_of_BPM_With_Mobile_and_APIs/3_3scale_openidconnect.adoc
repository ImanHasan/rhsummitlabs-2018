== Introduction

In this lab you will integrate OpenID Connect into 3Scale. This gives you single sign on for both 3Scale and BPMS.

==== Lab Summary
. Read me
. Configure the 3Scale api to use the OpenID Connect Authentication method.
. Edit the 3Scale api APIcast Configuration and set the OpenID Connect Issuer.
. Set the Application API Credentials Redirect URL
. Test using postman

== Read me

We integrate 3Scale with SSO by allowing 3Scale to push Applications into Red Hat SSO as users. To do this we provide you with a privileged service account that has access rights to perform REST calls to perform this action against our SSO instance.

The credentials for this service account are:
Client ID: 3scale_sync
Client Secret: 38cd5c45-fee4-4735-ae89-33dfcfad480d

If you would like more details refer to Appendix or official documentation https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/2.saas/html/api_authentication/ other versions of this documentation can be found from the product home page https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale/.

The BPM Server we expose via 3Scale must also be hooked up to SSO. As such we provide a new BPM server for the SSO lab. The differences being that HTTPS is enabled, and users are authenticated by SSO instead of basic auth.

== Configure the 3Scale api to use the OpenID Connect Authentication method.

NOTE: We assume the previous 3Scale lab has been completed.

. Click and expand username_default
. Click "edit integration settings" from the right hand corner.
. Scroll down the page until you get to the "Authentication" section.
. Select the OpenID Connect option.
. Click "Update Service" and confirm
+

== Edit the 3Scale api APIcast Configuration and set the OpenID Connect Issuer.

. Returning to the Integration homepage
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidhome.png[3Scale OpenID Home, 900]
. Click "edit APIcast configuration".
. Change your Private base url to the following server https://34.251.105.7:8443 (there is only 1 BPM SSO enabled server so everyone will use the same URL)
. Scroll down the page and enter the "OpenID Connect Issuer" url of https://3scale_sync:38cd5c45-fee4-4735-ae89-33dfcfad480d@auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit
+
NOTE: This is how 3Scale is able to push Applications into SSO. (This is explained in the readme)
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidprovider.png[3Scale OpenID Provider, 300]
. Click Update the staging environment
. Wait for the UI to test the OpenID Connect Issuer.
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidgreen.png[3Scale OpenID Green, 300]
. Click Integration from the left hand side returning to the integration home page and then "Promote to Production".

== Set the Application API Credentials Redirect URL

NOTE: At this stage any new Applications created for a Application plan linked to the OpenID backed API service will be synced into Red Hat SSO as a Client.

. Click on the "Developers" link from the top menu and select the Redhat-BPMS account.
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-developers.png[3Scale Developers, 300]
. Click on the Applications link.
. Click "Create Application".
. Select the relevant "Application Plan" from the drop down list.
. Click "Create Application", using your Application plan and a name of your choosing.
. The new application should now be displayed. Scroll down the page to the "API Credentials" section and set the "Redirect URL" value to "https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback".
+
NOTE: You may be thinking what is this odd url? Redirect URLs are part of a OAuth flow which container a token. We use this URL in postman to get the login tokens provided by SSO. +

NOTE: You will need the Client ID and Client Secret for step 4, under API Credentials.

== Test the configuration using Postman

In this section we test the service via Postman

NOTE: We use the google plugin Postman not the native Postman app. Steps change slightly on the google plugin but is very similar.

. Open postman and create a new request
. Click "Create Collection", give it a name and click Create.
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidpostman.png[3Scale Postman, 600]

. Setup a GET request to your 3Scale staging or production url with the following subpath - kie-server/services/rest/server/containers
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidpostmanrequest.png[3Scale Postman Request, 600]
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidrequest2.png[3Scale Postman Request 2, 600]
	** For example https://summit-student-14-default-2445582504254.staging.gw.apicast.io:443/kie-server/services/rest/server/containers
	** You can retrieve the URLS from the Integration home page of your API
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-openidenvs.png[3Scale Envs, 600]
. In Authorization select OAuth 2.0
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-postman-oauthtype.png[3Scale OAuth, 600]
. Click Get New Access Token
. Enter the following
	** Token Name - Anything
	** Callback URL - https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback
	** Auth URL - https://auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit/protocol/openid-connect/auth
	** Access Token URL - https://auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/realms/summit/protocol/openid-connect/token
	** Client ID - `Application id from Step 3`
	** Client Secret - `Application secret from Step 3`
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-getaccesstoken.png[3Scale Get Access Token, 600]
. Click Request Token
    ** Your now redirected to the SSO login page
    ** Login using your username summit-student-NUM and password sso#2018
. Click on your new token and then click Use Token
+
image::../Unleash_the_Power_of_BPM_With_Mobile_and_APIs/images/3scale-usetoken.png[3Scale Use Token, 600]
. Execute the Send request
. Note the request succeeded (Response code 200). As we are only using this BPM server for SSO we have not deployed any containers hence the empty payload.
+

NOTE: A postman request example can be found in this script under the 3Scale folder: link:other/Summit_BPM_Postman_Collection.postman_collection.json[Summit BPM Lab Collection] +
Please refer to <<1_Deploy_And_Manage_BPM_Container.adoc#,Postman Setup>> if you need help importing these files.

== Appendix

=== Create 3Scale service account in the RH SSO realm.

This account will be used by 3Scale to perform client synchronisation.
["arabic"]
. Open a browser and access the Redhat SSO Admin user interface
.. https://auth-summit.tk:8443/auth/admin/
. Select the relevant realm
. Create a new client by selecting the Clients menu item from the left side and click the Create button.
. Set the following values and click save:
    * Client Id : 3scale-admin
    * Client Protocol : OpenId-Connect
. On the client settings tab set the following values and click save:
    * Standard Flow Enabled = OFF
    * Direct Access Grants = Enabled
		* Access Type = confidential
    * Service Accounts Enabled = On
. Click the Service Accounts tab that now should be visible. If it's not visible you may need to refresh the page.
. Click on the Client Roles drop down and select Realm Management from the list. A list of Available Roles should now appear.
. Select manage-clients and click Add Selected to move the role across to the Assign Roles section. The role should also appear in the Effective Roles section.
. Click on the credentials tab and take a copy of the secret as this will be required shortly.
. Check that a user with the kieserver role exists within the realm. If one doesn't exist then you will need to follow the labs on how to configure Redhat SSO and Redhat BPMS.

NOTE: Currently a http request is used because the service account option is not exposed
