### Short intro

In this hands-on lab, we'll review using OpenSCAP to perform automated security compliance for bare-metal machines, virtual machines, and containers. SCAP content customization lets you fit security policies to your use case.

### Lab instructions

The Practical OpenSCAP lab is divided in two parts.

On part 1, attendees will go through OpenSCAP on the command-line, execute scans, generate reports and perform remediations.
