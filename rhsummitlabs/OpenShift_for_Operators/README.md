# OpenShift for Operators

The OpenShift for Operators lab uses a platform called Qwiklabs for providing
the underlying student environments. The instructors should have already set up
your workstation with a lab environment. Each lab environment has a custom-built
lab guide inside it.

If for some reason your station does not have a Qwiklab environment ready for
you, or if you're reading this, you should probably raise your hand and ask for
assistance.
